# tsep

tsep is a fork of https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsep written in Typescript. tsep is not backwards compatible with jsep because jsep is a singleton whereas tsep uses parser engine instances so you can have many different parser configurations within one app.

This library was generated with [Nx](https://nx.dev).

## Building

Run `nx build tsep` to build the library.

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test tsep` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).
